# Message Board Site
## This is a project to create a simple message board / forum site!
### User Accounts
Users can register accounts, create "spaces," make posts, and soon, leave replies to posts.
Posts can be up to 1,000 characters long and can contain images up to 1 MB in size! User accounts have usernames, display names, bio's, and profile pictures.

### Security
Passwords must be 8 characters long, and are encrypted when stored in the database. The site uses session-based authentication to verify with the server that a user is logged in every time they attempt to add or change any content on the site.

### Display Names
Display Names are like nicknames! If set, they get displayed in place of your username. Usernames cannot be changed, but display names can. Display Names can have special symbols, emojis, or characters that would not work in a username, since your username is used to log in. 
Furthermore, display names can be set to display in any color! Just take the 6-digit hex code for your favorite color and enter in the field under your account settings, and press update!
